### Hello Explorer ðŸ‘‹,

You must have stumbled upon my Github profile using the link I gave you somewhere. Congratulations, you now can take a look at what I have to offer to the open source community or maybe your company (**wink*).

My name is Shen Wei, I am a Computer Science student at Purdue University. I am also a part-time Full-stack Engineer at the Purdue Center of Career Opportunity, maintaining and building the department's website.

I am trying to find an internship in Summer 2021 so that I can gain more experience in the Software Engineering world. It is Feburary 2021 and I am still looking for it. :')

If you are a recruiter, please give me a chance to at least interview. :pleading_face: I promise I will not disappoint.
